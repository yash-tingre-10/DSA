When realise there's nothing left other than focusing on your self betterment.
Neither of your friends are that supportive of what you are doing nor they want to excell
in their own feild. Just do everything on the last moment. I realised this is not going to
last for a long time and it's time to change myself for my future self and move  to better
friendships or relationships if that's what makes you grow
